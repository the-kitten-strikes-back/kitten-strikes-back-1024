Hi there! I’m **Sidharth** 👋  
A Python(I know, I know...) programmer and cybersecurity enthusiast who loves breaking things (ethically) and building tools that go ***fast*** ⚡ (come on, Python's not *that* slow!)

---

## 🔐 Cybersecurity & CTFs
- Active **TryHackMe** learner  
- Interested in:
  - Network security
  - Recon & exploitation
  - Custom security tooling
  - Red-team style labs



---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, Bash(Bash forever!!), a bit of HTML(Who doesn't know HTML), and Ruby(Learning)  
- **Security Tools:** Nmap, Metasploit, custom scanners, (RustScan is the best!!)
- **Game / Simulation Dev:** Ursina, Pygame
- **Other Interests:** Reverse engineering, automation, 

---

## 🚀 Projects
Some things you’ll find here:
- ⚡ **Lightning** – a high-speed Python port scanner & recon tool  
- 🎮 Simulation & game experiments (flight sims, physics-heavy projects)  - Check out flyer101
- 🔍 Security utilities, exploit codes, and learning-focused code   

> Most projects are built from scratch to understand the *why*, not just the *how*.

---

## 📈 What I’m Currently Doing
- Improving Python performance & multiprocessing (How to make Python faster)
- Practicing real-world CTF techniques
- Building larger, more structured security tools
- Learning more about exploitation frameworks
